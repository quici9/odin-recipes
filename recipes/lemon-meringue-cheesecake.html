    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups shortbread cookie crumbs</li>
      <li>¼ cup melted butter</li>
      <li>3 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened</li>
      <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
      <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
      <li>4 eggs</li>
      <li>¼ cup fresh lemon juice</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1 lemon, zested</li>
      <li>4 egg whites</li>
      <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon cream of tartar (Optional)</li>
      <li>1 ½ cups lemon curd</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 1</strong>
        <p>Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 2</strong>
        <p>
          Mix cookie crumbs and melted butter together in a bowl until evenly
          combined; press into the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 3</strong>
        <p>
          Beat cream cheese, sour cream, and 1 cup sugar together in a bowl
          using an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Add eggs one at a
          time, beating well after each addition. Mix lemon juice, vanilla
          extract, and lemon zest into cream cheese mixture, scraping bottom and
          sides of the bowl. Spread mixture over cookie crust in the springform
          pan.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 4</strong>
        <p>
          Bake in the preheated oven until almost set in the center, about 1
          hour. Cool to room temperature and refrigerate until completely
          cooled, at least 3 to 4 hours.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 5</strong>
        <p>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 6</strong>
        <p>
          Beat egg whites in a bowl using an electric mixer until soft peaks
          form; add 1/4 cup sugar and cream of tartar and beat until stiff, but
          not dry, peaks form.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 7</strong>
        <p>
          Spread lemon curd over cheesecake. Mound whipped egg whites over the
          curd, sealing around all the edges.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 8</strong>
        <p>
          Bake in the preheated oven until meringue is golden brown, about 10
          minutes. Chill uncovered in refrigerator, about 1 hour.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Cook's Notes:</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        This can be made the day before and kept in the fridge. In fact, I think
        it tastes even better the day after like most cheesecakes. Make sure not
        to cover it or your meringue may collapse.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can also make 2 of these in one shot and freeze one without the
        meringue for later use. I make my own lemon curd using the leftover egg
        yolks from the meringue.
