    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 1</strong>
        <p>
          Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a large bowl, mix
          together the cookie crumbs, confectioners' sugar and 1/3 cup cocoa.
          Add melted butter and stir until well mixed. Pat into the bottom of a
          9 inch springform pan. Bake in preheated oven for 10 minutes; set
          aside. Increase oven temperature to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 2</strong>
        <p>
          In a large bowl, combine cream cheese, white sugar, 1/4 cup cocoa and
          flour. Beat at medium speed until well blended and smooth. Add eggs
          one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Blend in the sour
          cream and Irish cream liqueur; mixing on low speed. Pour filling over
          baked crust.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 3</strong>
        <p>
          Bake at 450 degrees F (230 degrees C) for 10 minutes. Reduce oven
          temperature to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C), and continue baking for
          60 minutes.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 4</strong>
        <p>
          With a knife, loosen cake from rim of pan. Let cool, then remove the
          rim of pan. Chill before serving. If your cake cracks, a helpful tip
          is to dampen a spatula and smooth the top, then sprinkle with some
          chocolate wafer crumbs.
