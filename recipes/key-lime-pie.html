        When I moved from Lebanon to Florida spring of 1999, I brought with me
        my love for cooking and search for new recipes. The famous key lime pie
        was new to me. It was a friend's best dessert, and he used to buy it
        from Costco every time we go for shopping. I tasted the pie at several
        places, but they were missing that wow flavor. I kept playing with the
        recipe, and the right flavor is found. I live now in North Bay, Ontario,
        and we only get the Key Limes twice a year, so sometimes I substitute
        with fresh lime juice. I hope you all enjoy!!

      <li>1 cup graham cracker crumbs</li>
      <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
      <li>1 pinch salt</li>
      <li>¼ cup butter, melted</li>
      <li>4 egg yolks</li>
      <li>1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
      <li>½ cup key lime juice</li>
      <li>¾ cup cold heavy cream</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon grated lime zest</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 1</strong>
        <p>Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 2</strong>
        <p>
          Pulse the almonds in a food processor until finely ground. Combine the
          almonds with the graham cracker crumbs, sugar, and salt. Pour in the
          melted butter and mix until evenly moistened. Press into a 9-inch pie
          plate.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 3</strong>
        <p>
          Bake the crust in the preheated oven until golden brown, 10 to 13
          minutes.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 4</strong>
        <p>
          While the crust is baking, beat the egg yolks in a bowl with the
          condensed milk, cream, and lime zest. Whisk in the lime juice a little
          at a time to thicken the custard. Pour the custard into the pie crust
          and return to the oven.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 5</strong>
        <p>
          Bake in the oven for 15 minutes to help the custard begin to set. Cool
          to room temperature on a wire rack before covering loosely with
          plastic wrap and refrigerating overnight.
