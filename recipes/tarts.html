      </ul>
    </div>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 1</strong>
        <p>
          Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a
          9-inch tart pan with a removable bottom.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 2</strong>
        <p>
          Mix pretzel crumbs, brown sugar, melted butter, and salt together in a
          bowl until mixture resembles wet sand. Pour into the tart pan, and
          press very firmly and evenly up the sides and into the bottom of the
          pan.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 3</strong>
        <p>
          Place tart pan onto a baking sheet and bake until crust is golden
          brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Allow crust to cool completely in pan, about
          30 minutes.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 4</strong>
        <p>
          Combine heavy cream, butter, vanilla extract, and salt in a small
          saucepan over medium-low heat and cook until butter is melted and
          mixture begins to bubble, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat, set aside,
          and keep warm.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 5</strong>
        <p>
          Combine sugar, corn syrup, and water in a large light-colored saucepan
          with high sides. Cook over medium heat, swirling occasionally, until
          mixture is amber in color, 10 to 12 minutes. Reduce heat to low, and
          very carefully whisk in reserved cream-butter mixture, as caramel
          mixture will bubble up and steam; stir constantly.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 6</strong>
        <p>
          Insert a candy thermometer into the mixture and cook over low heat,
          stirring occasionally, until caramel reaches 245 degrees F (118
          degrees C), 25 to 30 minutes. Carefully pour caramel into an even
          layer in the baked and cooled crust. Allow caramel layer to cool until
          set, 1 to 2 hours.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 7</strong>
        <p>
          Prepare the chocolate layer. Pour stout beer into a saucepan and bring
          to a boil over medium-high heat. Cook until stout has been reduced to
          1/4 cup, 20 to 25 minutes. Pour reduced stout into a large bowl. Stir
          in chopped chocolate, chocolate chips, butter, and vanilla and set
          aside.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 8</strong>
        <p>
          Heat cream in a small saucepan over medium-low heat until just
          simmering, 3 to 5 minutes. Pour over chocolate and allow to sit for 5
          minutes. Stir until chocolate is completely melted and smooth.
          Carefully pour melted chocolate over the cooled caramel layer, making
          sure not overflow the pan.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 9</strong>
        <p>
          Use a toothpick to pop any air bubbles that may arise. Allow chocolate
          layer to cool and set up completely, 1 to 2 hours.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Cook's Notes:</h2>
    <p>
      The brand of pretzels used in the crust matters, as some are saltier than
      others. I used Rold Gold(R), which were not that salty, thus I added extra
      salt to the crust for a better sweet-salty balance. If your pretzels are
      saltier, you may not need the added salt. Adjust to taste. Also make sure
      that the pretzels are crushed very fine (I ran them through a food
      processor to achieve this) or it will be difficult to press the crust into
      the pan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Make sure to use a candy thermometer for the caramel. It needs to reach
      approximately "firm ball stage" at 245 degrees F (118 degrees C). This
      allows the caramel to set up firmly, but still be soft enough to eat.
      However, a softer caramel may be achieved by cooking it only to "soft ball
      stage" at 240 degrees F (115 degrees C), though this may not set up as
      nicely as a layer. The time it takes to reach this temperature can vary
      substantially, so be sure to use the thermometer for accuracy.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will probably have extra chocolate that won't fit; only pour as much
      as needed to fill the tart shell and cover the caramel without overflowing
      the pan. Save the extra for another use.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's important to serve this tart at room temperature, as the caramel
      hardens substantially when chilled. This tart may be made up to several
      days in advance, as long as it is kept chilled; but be sure to bring it
      back to room temp before serving. For easier cutting, run a sharp knife
      under hot water, then dry it off on a towel. The warmed knife should allow
      for easier and cleaner cuts.
